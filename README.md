# Commuters
Census data with commuter data, average commute time to work, demographic characteristics of neighborhoods
Data on commuting and census tract demographics for the ABC News / OTV analysis was collected from the 2022 U.S. Census American Community Survey, Demographic Profile tables DP03, DP04 and DP05. We also used census geographic classifications to assign geographic regions and urban / rural designations to each U.S. census tract. We calculated descriptive categories for some fields (income, race, no-vehicle households, etc.) by using “natural breaks” in ranges based on percentages in those fields.
